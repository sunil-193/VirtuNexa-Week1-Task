Countdown Timer Description: An chronometer is an electronic device that counts down from a pre-set time, and sounds an alarm or displays a message when the countdown reaches zero. Users can configure the countdown duration in minutes or seconds based on their needs. It provides a visual display of the remaining time that steadily decreases until it expires. When the timer concludes its countdown, it signals the conclusion either through a message popup, sound alert, or other visual indication.

Structure: The timer is operated through a graphical user interface that allows setting the countdown period. It utilizes core programming techniques to concurrently manage the countdown display and alarm notification. Threading ensures the timer update and response to expiration complete independently. Users enter the minutes or seconds for the countdown and press start, upon which the chronometer commences counting down. Once it reaches zero, the program triggers a message to alert the user the countdown has ended.

Calculator Description: A computational device allows performing basic arithmetic including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers or decimal numbers. It incorporates fault handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs that could cause errors, like dividing by zero. The calculator runs interactively to make continuous calculations until the user decides to quit.

Structure: The calculator is operated through a console interface where functions and values are entered. It supports the fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Inputs are checked for erroneous data before calculations occur to prevent crashes. Continuous use lets repetitive calculations be made until the user chooses to terminate the program.
